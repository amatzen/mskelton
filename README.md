### Hi, I'm Mark 👋

I'm a software developer and follower of Christ located in Madison, Wisconsin. I currently work at [Widen Enterprises](https://github.com/Widen) as a Junior JavaScript Engineer.

## 🔭 Recent Projects

- I developed [JetBrains One Dark Theme](https://github.com/one-dark/jetbrains-one-dark-theme) which has become a very popular color theme for JetBrains IDEs. Recently I've been working with @Unthrottled to continue making improvements to the theme.
- My most recent large project is [PropTypes to TS](https://github.com/mskelton/prop-types-to-ts), an CLI/web tool to automatically convert React propTypes to TypeScript definitions.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

- [React Query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query) v2. React Query is an awesome library by @tannerlinsley for simplifying data fetching in your React components.
- [CSS grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout). I know flexbox pretty well, but it's time to jump on the grid train.
- [Emotion 10](https://emotion.sh). My company is working on migrating from Emotion 9 to Emotion 10. Emotion is awesome, migrations are not. 😁

## ⚡ Fun facts

- The first programming language I learned was Python which I almost never use anymore. 🐍
- I'm terrible at design and yet I maintain color themes for 2 IDEs and 2 websites. 🤷‍♂️
- I'm currently the youngest employee at my company at 21 years old. 👶
